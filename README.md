# unofficial-valorant-api (v.3.0.0)
Unofficial Valorant API by using the Ingame API

<a href="https://discord.gg/X3GaVkX2YN" target="_blank"><img src="https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/704231681309278228/widget.png?style=banner2"/></a>

# Before using this API
Please make sure that the user has given his consent to use his data. Analytic services where the user haven't giving his consent are not supported and will be banned if found out, same goes with store checkers if they are public

# Authentication and Rate Limits
All rate limits are the same for every endpoint, so in general you have **90 requests every minute** if you use an API Key, if not it will be **30 requests every minute** based on the IP.
If you exceed rate limit you will get following JSON with 429 Status Code:
```json
{
  "status": 429,
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Rate Limited",
      "code": 0,
      "global": false
    }
  ]
}
```
The API party uses a key based system, with the guarantee that you will receive an answer to your application within 24-48h. This change happened because of large botting attacks and data privacy reasons which could impact all other developers.

You can generate a key on the linked discord above. 

*You will also have to enter some details about your app, e.g., the use case. This is to ensure the API is not used in a harmful way and (hopefully) the user knows that his data is used.*

There are also some Rate Limit Adjustments:
- No Key: 
   - 30req/min (2 uncached accounts/hour)
   - Suitable for: Twitch Bots | Educational purposes (How do i code etc)
- Basic Key:
    - 90req/min (unlimited uncached accounts/hour if available)
    - Suitable for: Private Discord Bots (Servers) | Websites
- Production Key:
    - Rate Limit you requested
    - Suitable for: Production Discord Bots | Websites
    - PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT YOU ALSO REQUEST AN OFFICIAL VALORANT API KEY AT RIOT TO GET RSO IF YOU HAVE A STATS FEATURE FOR EXAMPLE
    
**IMPORTANT**

What is not allowed?
- Big analytic projects
    - Why? Because of data privacy. Riot set RSO as a requirement for their official API because the VAL Team said they want to protect the users data. Since I dont want to get into trouble with Riot and want to keep up the API as long as possible for normal developers out there this is a requirement
- Public store trackers / store websites / store bots
    - Why? Because it's simply not allowed and the risk of scamming accounts is also way to high. If it's a private project for a couple of friends you will receive a key, but as soon as I find out that the project is used in the public the key will get revoked.
